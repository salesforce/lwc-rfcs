# `lwc:on` Directive

## Summary

This proposal introduces a mechanism to add a collection of event listeners which may be computed dynamically to elements in an LWC template using a new directive, `lwc:on`.

## Basic example

```js
// x/myComponent.js
export default class MyComponent extends LightningElement {

    _someField = 'some value';

    childEventHandlers = {
        foo: function (event) {console.log('foo');} ,
        bar: function (event) {console.log(this._someField);}
    };

}
```

```html
 <!-- x/myComponent.html -->
<template>
  <x-child lwc:on={childEventHandlers}></x-child>
</template>
```

The `lwc:on` directive uses the properties of the `childEventHandlers` object to set up event listeners on `<x-child>`. Each property key in the object specifies an event type to listen for, and when that event occurs, the corresponding property's value will be invoked with `this` set to the `MyComponent` instance.  
In this example, when `<x-child>` receives a 'foo' event, it logs 'foo' to the console. When it receives a 'bar' event, it logs 'some value' to the console because `this` is the `MyComponent` instance.


## Motivation

LWC's current support for declarative event listeners is limited to scenarios where event types are known at the time of authoring the owner component's HTML template. There is no way to declaratively add event listeners for event types that are determined dynamically.

A common use case arises when using the `lwc:component` directive, where event listeners may depend on the current value of the constructor passed to `lwc:is`. In such cases, the event types cannot be known in advance when authoring the owner component's HTML template.

As an alternative, it is possible to add event listeners imperatively. However, this requires the owner component to have a reference to the element on which the listener needs to be added. This reference is only available after the element has been connected. Since LWC doesn't provide a mechanism to pass the control flow back to owner component immediately after the element is connected, this makes it impossible for owner component to handle events dispatched by the component in between of being connected and owner component getting the control flow. Typically, this means the owner component cannot handle events dispatched by the `connectedCallback` and `renderedCallback` of the corresponding component.

## Detailed design

The `lwc:on` directive will enable the addition of a collection of event listeners whose event types may not be known at the time of HTML template authoring.

In this document, `element` shall refer to the rendered `Element` and `component` shall refer to the instance of `LightningElememt`.  
In this document, the value of an object's property shall refer to the result of calling the [Get](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-get-o-p) operation with the object and the property's key as arguments.

### Directive behaviour 

The `lwc:on` directive would accept an object. For each property of the object, it would add a event listener to the `element` that listens for the event type specified by property's key. The property's value with `this` set to the owner `component` would be used for handling the event.

### Considered Properties

Only own enumerable string-keyed properties of object passed to `lwc:on` will be considered. Other properties, i.e. inherited properties, non-enumerable properties and symbol-keyed properties shall be ignored. The only restriction on property keys is that they must be strings â€” any string, such as 'fooBar', 'foo-bar', or even '', is valid.

### Non-callable Property Values

When a property value in the object passed to `lwc:on` is not callable, the directive will not throw an error during the addition of the event listener. Instead, it will throw an error when that event is handled. This behavior is consistent with how event listeners added via the `onXXX` syntax in HTML templates work.

### Object Mutation and Identifier Reassignment

The object referenced by the identifier passed to `lwc:on` should not be mutated. However, the identifier itself may be reassigned to a different object. This means that while you can change which object the identifier points to, you should not modify the properties of the object itself.

```js
// x/myComponent.js
export default class MyComponent extends LightningElement {
    handlers = {
        click: () => console.log('clicked')
    };

    // Valid: Reassigning the identifier to a new object
    updateHandlers() {
        this.handlers = {
            click: () => console.log('new click handler'),
            mouseover: () => console.log('mouseover')
        };
    }

    // Invalid: Mutating the object directly
    invalidUpdate() {
        this.handlers.click = () => console.log('new click handler'); // Don't do this
        this.handlers.mouseover = () => console.log('mouseover'); // Don't do this
    }
}
```

### Event Listener Updates

When an identifier passed to `lwc:on` is reassigned to a different object, the event listeners are updated accordingly on re-render:
- New properties in the object will have their event listeners added
- Properties that no longer exist in the object will have their event listeners removed
- Properties that exist in both the old and new objects but with different values will have their event listeners updated

```js
// x/myComponent.js
export default class MyComponent extends LightningElement {
    handlers = {
        click: () => console.log('clicked'),
        mouseover: () => console.log('mouseover')
    };

    updateHandlers() {
        // This will:
        // 1. Remove the mouseover event listener
        // 2. Update the click event listener
        // 3. Add a new keydown event listener
        this.handlers = {
            click: () => console.log('new click handler'),
            keydown: () => console.log('key pressed')
        };
    }
}
```

### Compatibility between various Event Listener Declarations 

There can be only one `lwc:on` directive on an element.  
`lwc:on` directive cannot be used together with event listeners declared directly in the HTML template (using `onXXX` syntax) on the same element.

Event listeners specified by `lwc:on` are added completely independently of event listener properties specified by `lwc:spread`, i.e. If `lwc:on` and `lwc:spread` specify listeners for the same event type, then both event listeners will be added. They do not override or overwrite each other in any way.


## Drawbacks

- It is not possible to statically analyze the names of event listeners added by this directive.
- The `lwc:on` directive cannot be used together with event listeners declared using the `onXXX` syntax on the same element, which may limit flexibility in certain scenarios.
- The object passed to `lwc:on` cannot be mutated - only reassignment of the identifier to a new object is allowed. This may require additional code to create new objects when event handlers need to be updated.

## Alternatives

### lwc:spread - Just spreading it in template

An alternative design would be for `lwc:spread` to behave as a directive that appears to just spread the object's properties onto the template.

Currently, a component can execute logic in its `connectedCallback` based on the value of an attribute in its corresponding `element`. If an owner component uses `lwc:component` to consume this component, it may encounter issues similar to those described in the [# Motivation](#motivation). Although this is considered an anti-pattern, the author of the owner component might not have control over the consumed component, leading to a noticeable feature gap. The proposed design would address this issue.
 
Currently, `lwc:spread` can be used to listen for standard events like `click` or `focus` by assigning event handlers to the `onclick` or `onfocus` properties. This works because these properties are applied to `element`, meaning the event handlers are bound to the `elements` themselves, not to the owner `component` as `onclick` or `onfocus` on the template does. This behavior might be unexpected for consumers. The distinction between `element` and `component` is an implementation detail. For consumers, it is simply an Lwc, and this behavior cannot be explained as the application of properties to Lwc. The proposed design breaks this behaviour. However, any component that relies on the current behavior can be rewritten to accommodate the new design.

Although properties and event listeners use the same HTML attribute syntax, the distinction between them is a part of public API. Consumers are expected to understand their differences and reason about them separately. Combining them into a single directive does not seem to significantly enhance the developer experience. In fact, a combined directive might lead consumers to treat them as a unified concept, causing confusion. Additionally, the usage patterns of properties and event listeners are different, and a combined directive may complicate consumer code.

Currently, the segregation of properties, attributes, and event listeners is handled solely by the template compiler. This design would require implementing a runtime segregator, causing additional runtime overhead. Any changes in segregation rules would necessitate updates in both the compiler and the runtime engine, leading to increased maintenance effort.

### Event Handler Properties

Another alternative design considered is for the framework to create new properties named `on{eventType}` on the `component`. The setter for these properties would add an event listener to the corresponding `element`. This listener would listen for events with the type `eventType` and handle them using the input value bound to the `component`. In this design, the template-compiler output shall not distinguish between properties and event listeners, they shall all be treated as properties. This would enable us to use `lwc:spread` for dynamic addition of event listeners,

This approach presents significant implementation challenges. Since we can't know all the required event listeners during component construction, we would need to create properties dynamically when they are first encountered. The framework can handle `on*` properties defined in the HTML template easily because it manages the assignment. However it would require a proxy based mechanism for the framework to create these properties when first encountered elsewhere.

Similar to previous alternative, this design would be a breaking change and it doesn't seem to improve the developer experience significantly.

## Adoption strategy

This is a non breaking, observable change. Based on rollout statergy (TBD), customers may need to update some config to use this feature.

# How we teach this

The LWC documentation should be updated to include an explanation of this directive's behavior. Additionally, the documentation should encourage customers to use this directive instead of `lwc:spread` for dynamically adding event listeners.
